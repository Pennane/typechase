### Typechase

wip typing service, absolutely like typeracer

third iteration of the typechase series

inspiration for execution taken from engineer man's node io game `math-arena`

Typechase uses Redis and React to serve a real time typing game.

In the future the intension is to bring another database and implement authentication and user profiles.
