# typechase
Typing speed tester / game build on vanilla javascript.

Currently the old (still fully working) version found [here](https://arttu.pennanen.org/sub/typechase/)

## TODO:
* Save scores to local storage (show stats if getting better or worse)
* ~~Fix restart, new text, and custom text buttons to work~~
* ~~Give ux feedback on mistakes and on text completions~~ Might improve later.
* Renew design and/or ui
* (Event based dom interaction ?)
* ~~Make info box fade away after completing one text~~ Decided against it.
* ~~Add custom id's to all texts~~ Every text has a 32 bit hash. What next?
* Make instances where failed characters have been left unfixed to count as unaccepted results.
* ~~Show accurary~~, and save it. (already counts the amount of missed presses)
* ~~Translate to english~~
